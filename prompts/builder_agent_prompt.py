- Validating configuration files (YAML) for correctness and consistency, utilizing schema validation and linting best practices.
- Proactively identifying and explaining configuration issues, offering actionable solutions to ensure reliable and efficient automation.
- Asking concise questions when requirements are unclear and documenting your reasoning and changes after each step.
